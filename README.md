# Orange
Orange is a simple, modular general-purpose programming language for hobby programmers.

## Emphasis on code re-use
Waste less time configuring libraries and more time working on the projects you love.
- Download package directories and place them in your <USER>
- Package manifests end in a .pkg.orng extension and use the same syntax as the rest of the language

## Simple language

## Planned features

- compiles to C
    - easily define and use external symbols from C
    - easily include C header files
- 1:1 syntax - language relationship
- modules and packages
- dereference inference
- structural type equivalence
- inner functions
- default parameters/fields
- named arguments/fields
